Determine a random player to go first

The first player will roll a pair of dice up to 3 times trying to maximize their score.
They may end their turn after any of their rolls. "Locking in" their score.
The number of rolls they used is the maximum number of rolls each subsequent player is allowed to use on their turns.
Each subsequent player rolls similarly, but is allowed fewer than, or equal to the number of rolls the first player took.
A player's score is always the value of the final throw of the dice. Meaning previous rolls are discarded.
After each player has taken one turn (a full rotation of the table), the player with the lowest score loses.


Scoreing follows as:
21/12 -- Best possible, a "Mexico"
66
55
44
33
22
11
6 {5,4,3,2,1}
5 {4,3,2,1}
4 {3,2,1}
3 {2,1} a 31/13 being the worst possible
